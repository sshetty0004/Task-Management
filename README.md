# Angular 17 Task Management App

This project is a task management application built with *Angular 17*. The app allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and filter tasks. Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- *Add Task*: Input field for adding tasks with a title, due date, and optional description.
- *View Tasks*: Display all tasks in a list that persists between page refreshes.
- *Edit Task*: Modify existing tasks with the "Edit" button and update localStorage.
- *Delete Task*: Remove tasks from the list and localStorage using the "Delete" button.
- *Mark Task as Completed*: Mark tasks as completed, visually distinguishing them with a strikethrough or different background color.
- *Clear Completed Tasks*: Remove all completed tasks from the list and localStorage.
- *Filter Tasks*: Filter the task list to show all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks.
- Data persistence using localStorage.
